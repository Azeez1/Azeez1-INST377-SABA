# Azeez1-INST377-SABA

My name is Azeez Saba I am a rising senior at the University of Maryland - College Park.
In this class I am very excited to learn javascript and some apache. I will use these skills in my career because I plan on becoming a data scientist after I graduate so I believe these skills will be great tools to add to my arsenal.
